Whole Slide Imaging in Pathology,Grassroots DICOM,Manoj Alwani,"DICOM currently defines Image IODs by storing the rows and columns as unsigned short integer. This means that an image can only be at most of size 2^16 * 2^16 pixels. This is a limitation for Microscopy Images as, for example, WSI can go up to Terabytes in extreme conditions.In addition to these “hard” restrictions, another consideration is due to large amount of information in these images rapid panning and zooming should also be supported."

I propose to implement these additions to provide extra features such as seamless mouse pointer integration, clipboard sharing, and automatic screen resizing."
Build multiple Cabal packages in parallel,haskell.org,Mikhail Glushenkov,"Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. This project's aim is to augment Cabal with support for building packages in parallel. Many developers have multi-core machines, but Cabal runs the build process in a single thread, only making use of one core. If the build process could be parallelized, build times could be cut by perhaps a factor of 2-8, depending on the number of cores and opportunity of parallel execution available."
Convert the text package to use UTF–8 internally,haskell.org,Jasper Van der Jeugt,"For Haskell projects handling unicode text, the Text library offers both speed and simplicity-of-use. When it was written, benchmarks indicated that UTF-16 would be a good choice for the internal encoding in the library. However, these (rather artificial) benchmarks were did not take into account the time taken to 1) decode the ""Real World"" data and 2) encode it to write it back. I propose to 1) benchmark and 2) convert the library to UTF-8 if it is a faster choice for ""Real World""-applications."
Darcs Bridge,haskell.org,Owen Stephens,"My proposed project is to create a generic bridge that will enable easy interoperability and synchronisation between Darcs and other VCSs.

Semantic Schemas extension,Wikimedia Foundation,Ankit Garg,"Short summary: Semantic Schemas a proposed extension , that would let users and admins define everything about the wiki's data structure via XML contained within wiki pages. That XML in turn would be used to generate all the other relevant pages: templates, properties, forms, etc. And the XML would be editable via a helper form, so that ideally users would never have to do direct XML editing. Also, the XML could theoretically be imported from, and exported to, other data-structure formats."
Working Archival for Web Ciations,Wikimedia Foundation,nn123654,"Web Citations are currently the most popular form of citation on the Wikipedia project for inline references. They have the common of ""dieing"" when the URLs either change or the servers that they are hosted on go down. Given the nature of wikipedia and the need for verifiability this creates a significant content problem when sources that are used in articles are no longer available."

The bridge is in the responsibility of WordPress.org team and the plugin project is in my responsibility."
learn.wordpress.org,WordPress,Stаs Sușcov,"WordPress doesn't have an official handbook or a tutorial resources website. Even though the platform is very popular and used by a lot of people, there will always be people that will find hard to read/understand Codex articles and will search for books on topics they couldn't catch up. So the idea I would like to work on, is a new learning resource for WordPress community, that will offer courses, assignments and basic ""certification"" for everyone who wants to learn WordPress."
LocalStorage drafts backup,WordPress,Mihai Chereji,"My vision is that at the end of this project, a WordPress user will not care at if any time during him/her writing a post on his blog, his Internet connection goes down.Editing files (and posts) on the client and using localStorage to save drafts when the Internet connection goes down can make everyone’s experience with WordPress a lot more safe and maybe a little more enjoyable."
Refresh the Android App UI,WordPress,Anirudh S,"The UI for existing features could be more user-friendly. e.g. a dashboard-kind of an interface. This would lead to quick blogging on the go and remove unnecessary steps while performing basic operations like posting a new post, pictures and videos. Removing the current tab-kind of an interface and bringing in a grid interface like the current Twitter and Facebook app. The UX would also have to be improved. This means large buttons, easy to browse-interface and smooth graphic flows too."
Template Versioning Using Subversion,WordPress,David Julia,"I propose the creation of an interface for version control systems for the templates which integrates the display of revision information into the theme editor page.

Porting Wombat Asset Management System on to Flask (a developer friendly python framework) and integrate a 3D model viewer into the system,WorldForge,Pronoy Chopra,Wombat currently runs on Pylons 0.9.7 which is outdated. Porting Wombat to Flask is primarily because Flask is more developer friendly and subsequent updates don't really have lots of changes. Wombat was made to assist artists to work with assets in a repository without having to work with the VCS. Also a 3D assets viewer is required because game development repository has 3D models which have to be downloaded and viewed. Rather than that a preview should be given so that the job becomes easier.

Add Xen PV block device support to SeaBIOS,Xen.org,Daniel Castro,"Currently Xen is using for HVM Virtual machines a version of BIOS called rombios, ROMBIOS is functional but maintenance is difficult, it is a mixture of C and inline assembly.Xen wants to migrate to SeaBIOS, which happens to also be the qemu upstream and KVM BIOS of choice, that means that the source code is more maintainable.Then a modification to int0x13 will be done to use the PV Drivers via XenStore instead of the emulated device used in qemu."
Linux Based Stubdoms,Xen.org,Jiageng Yu,"Stubdoms are very small Xen PV guests used to run some software components that otherwise live in dom0. This project will implement a linux based stubdom, which provides device emulation to a particular HVM guest. Because we are using PV linux kernel and upstream qemu to build the system, there are many new problems to be addressed, such as: establishing the environment of linux based stubdom with minimal linux kernel and shared libraries which can contain the qemu process exactly, adapting simulation devices to their relevant frontend devices in an optimal way, addressing the save/restore problem, adding pci pass-through support, etc."
Paravirtualized audio,Xen.org,Giorgos Boutsioukis,"The project would be to implement paravirtualized audio in Xen, in some form. Two approaches are proposed: a high-level approach over PulseAudio and a low-level split device driver, similar to the existing."

Audio converter rewrite and multichannel support,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,Juho Vähä-Herttua,"Currently the XMMS2 converter is a large chunk of python generated code doing sample format conversion, linear interpolation and channel mixing. There has been suggestions to use libsamplerate, which is probably the best audio conversion library around, but its GPLv2 license is not suitable for the project. Goal is to add similar functionality with more liberal license, most likely something like LGPLv2+. At least the functionality of the current converter plus multichannel should be available."
GIMME 2 - My proposal for GSoC 2011,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,konr,"GIMME, originally developed for Google's Summer of Code in 2010, is a well-rounded XMMS2 interface for GNU Emacs that provides a minimalistic and intuitive user experience through searches, powered by collection operations. It works very nicely, but still lacks the polishing top-quality Emacs packages have, modern features other interfaces have and a userbase. I propose to work on all of these issues in this summer."
LADSPA plugin support and improved effects chain management,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,mantaraya36,"Currently XMMS2 only possesses a very basic selection of audio processes that can be added to the signal chain. Since LADSPA plugins offer complex functionality it will be important to enhance the configuration interface to support richer data interchange, through the development of a schema mechanism for properties and dynamic modification of effect chains."
Service Clients,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,Guilherme Gonçalves,"This proposal aims to revise, extend and finish the implementation of ServiceClients in XMMS2 started in 2008 by Dan Chokola, document its functionality,and integrate it with the rest of the code base and test framework."
